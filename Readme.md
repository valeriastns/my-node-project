## Code Coverage
*Code coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed when running tests.*
### What we measure in this project?
*The main metrics measured are:*
-  **Lines:** % of lines in your code that are executed during tests. This shows how much of the written code is being executed, ensuring that no lines of code are left untested.
-  **Branches:** % of conditional branches (e.g., `if`, `else`) that are tested. This ensures that all possible paths through the code are executed during tests, covering every condition.
-  **Functions:** % of functions in the code that are executed by the tests. Each function should be covered by at least one test to ensure that it behaves correctly under various conditions.

### 10. Running Code Coverage
*To check the code coverage, run the following command:*
```bash
npx jest --coverage
```

### 11. Results
*We can check the result in terminal output or we can open the coverage folder in our project, then Icov-report folder and open index.html file with our Live Server*
